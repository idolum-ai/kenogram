# Contributing

Kenogram accepts small changes that strengthen an observable contract.

1. Read the relevant file in `requirements/` and keep contract, evidence, and
   implementation claims distinct.
2. Add the smallest test that would fail without the change. Prefer standard
   library mechanisms and exact postconditions over test frameworks.
3. Run `make check` for every change.
4. Run `make integration` for namespace, proxy, Podman, mount, or runtime
   evidence changes.
5. Run `make e2e` for lifecycle, generated configuration, Engram, or destruction
   changes.
6. Include failure-path evidence for lifecycle mutations. At most one
   generation may own a writable workspace after any injected failure.

Do not add third-party Go dependencies, generic runtime abstractions, or new
integration fixtures unless they prove a boundary not already covered. Report
security issues privately as described in [`.github/SECURITY.md`](.github/SECURITY.md).
